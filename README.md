# My Portfolio

My Portfolio is a website that I created to showcase my skills and talents. I am a self-learner and I am constantly improving my skills in full stack development. The website is built using Next.js, Tailwind, Firebase, Emails, and Framer Motion.

## Features

* **Portfolio showcase:** The website features a portfolio of my work, including projects that I have worked on and my skills.
* **Contact form:** Visitors can contact me through a contact form.
* **Blog:** I will be using the blog section to share my thoughts and experiences on full stack development.
* **Projects:** I will be adding a section to the website where I will showcase the projects that I have worked on.
